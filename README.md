# CSharpProblemSet

This repository contains a collection of problem-solving exercises implemented in C# as part of a programming practice set. Each problem is organized into its own class for clarity and modularity.

## Problem List

- **SecondMaxProblem** – Find the second largest number in an array
- **FirstNonRepeatingCharacterProblem** – Return the first non-repeating character in a string
- **MissingArrayProblem** – Find the missing number in a sequence from 1 to N
- **InsertionSortProblem** – Sort an array using the Insertion Sort algorithm
- **ArrayMaxProblem** – Return the maximum value in an array
- **VowelCountProblem** – Count the number of vowels in a given string

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo or open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. In `Program.cs`, you can call each problem’s method for testing.
3. Run the project (`Ctrl + F5`) to see the output in the console.


## Technologies Used

# CSharpProblemSet

This repository contains a collection of problem-solving exercises implemented in C# as part of a programming practice set. Each problem is organized into its own class for clarity and modularity.

## Problem List

1. **SecondMaxProblem**  
   Find the second largest number in an array.
2. **FirstNonRepeatingCharacterProblem**  
   Return the first non-repeating character in a string.
3. **MissingArrayProblem**  
   Find the missing number in a sequence from 1 to N.
4. **InsertionSortProblem**  
   Sort an array using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
5. **ArrayMaxProblem**  
   Return the maximum value in an array.
6. **VowelCountProblem**  
   Count the number of vowels in a given string.
7. **ReverseStringProblem**  
   Write a method that takes a string and returns it in reverse order.
8. **MergeSortedArraysProblem**  
   Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array (without using built-in sort).
9. **StringContainsOnlyDigitsProblem**  
   Return true if a string contains only numeric digits.
10. **MultithreadedPrimeFinderProblem**  
   Use `Task` and `async/await` to find all prime numbers between 1 and 1,000,000 efficiently.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo or open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. In `Program.cs`, you can call each problem’s method for testing.
3. Run the project (`Ctrl + F5`) to see the output in the console.
